# GCT Framework Enhancements

This document describes the six major enhancements added to the core GCT framework based on the excellent suggestions provided.

## 1. Temporal Coherence Patterns (`temporal_coherence.py`)

Analyzes coherence variations across time cycles and life transitions.

### Features:
- **Circadian Pattern Analysis**: Identifies whether someone is a morning, evening, or variable coherence person
- **Weekly Cycle Tracking**: Maps stress accumulation and recovery patterns across days
- **Life Transition Impact**: Measures how major life changes affect coherence trajectories
- **Optimal Timing Prediction**: Recommends best times for important decisions, difficult conversations, etc.

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/temporal/analyze` - Analyze user's temporal patterns
- `POST /api/temporal/optimal-timing` - Get optimal timing for specific activities

### Example Use Case:
Someone preparing for a difficult conversation can get recommendations on when they'll be at peak coherence, increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome.

## 2. Coherence Recovery Protocols (`coherence_recovery.py`)

Provides specific interventions for recovering from low coherence states (howlround).

### Features:
- **Urgency Assessment**: Determines how critical coherence recovery is (critical/high/moderate/low)
- **Targeted Interventions**: Specific practices for each coherence variable
- **Emergency Protocols**: Immediate grounding techniques for crisis states
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors recovery trajectory and adjusts plans

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/recovery/generate-plan` - Generate personalized recovery plan
- `POST /api/recovery/track-progress` - Track recovery progress

### Example Interventions:
- **For Low Ψ**: "Write 3 pages about a time your actions matched your values"
- **For Low ρ**: "Identify 3 recurring life patterns and their lessons"
- **For Low q**: "Take one small action today that scares you but aligns with values"
- **For Low f**: "Share something vulnerable with a trusted friend"

## 3. Coherence-AI Interaction Modeling (`ai_coherence_interaction.py`)

Tracks how AI interactions affect human coherence over time.

### Features:
- **Interaction Classification**: Categorizes AI use (informational, emotional, creative, etc.)
- **Impact Prediction**: Predicts coherence changes from AI usage patterns
- **Dependency Detection**: Identifies unhealthy AI reliance patterns
- **Authenticity Drift Measurement**: Tracks if AI use is affecting authentic expression

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/ai-interaction/analyze` - Analyze single AI interaction
- `POST /api/ai-interaction/predict-trajectory` - Predict impact of planned AI usage

### Key Insights:
- Emotional support from AI has highest dependency risk (0.8) and negative social impact
- Self-reflection use of AI can actually improve coherence
- Recommends "AI-free days" when dependency score exceeds 0.7

## 4. Cross-Cultural Coherence Calibration (`cultural_calibration.py`)

Adjusts coherence measurements and interpretations for cultural context.

### Features:
- **9 Cultural Contexts**: From individualist Western to collectivist Eastern, Nordic, Indigenous, etc.
- **Expression Modifiers**: Adjusts for how coherence is expressed in different cultures
- **Value Priorities**: Weights variables differently based on cultural values
- **Communication Style Mapping**: Accounts for direct vs. indirect expression patterns

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/cultural/calibrate` - Calibrate assessment for cultural context
- `GET /api/cultural/insights` - Get culturally-aware recommendations

### Example Adjustments:
- **Collectivist cultures**: Social belonging (f) weighted 40% vs. 20% in individualist
- **Nordic cultures**: High consistency expected, but understated moral action
- **Mediterranean**: High emotional expression affects all measurements

## 5. Coherence Contagion Modeling (`coherence_contagion.py`)

Models how coherence spreads through groups and social networks.

### Features:
- **Group Field Strength**: Calculates ambient coherence influence in groups
- **Asymmetric Transmission**: High-wisdom individuals transmit more, receive less
- **Catalyst Identification**: Finds individuals who can improve group coherence
- **Critical Threshold Detection**: Identifies when groups approach breakdown

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/contagion/analyze-group` - Analyze group coherence dynamics
- `POST /api/contagion/predict-impact` - Predict individual impact from group exposure

### Key Findings:
- Groups below 1.2 coherence enter rapid deterioration
- Family groups have strongest field effect (0.8 base strength)
- Online groups have weakest field effect (0.3) but highest boundary permeability

## 6. Coherence Development Prediction (`coherence_development_prediction.py`)

Predicts individual coherence trajectories and optimizes intervention timing.

### Features:
- **Development Archetypes**: Steady builder, breakthrough-prone, cyclical, resistant learner
- **Breakthrough Window Identification**: Predicts when major improvements likely
- **Setback Risk Assessment**: Identifies vulnerable periods (holidays, isolation, etc.)
- **Personalized Development Plans**: Weekly protocols based on personality and constraints

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/development/predict` - Predict 12-week development trajectory
- `POST /api/development/optimize-plan` - Generate optimized development plan

### Success Factors:
- Having 2+ support types increases success probability by 10%
- Time availability <30 min/day reduces success by 10%
- Wisdom (ρ) >0.5 adds 5% to success probability

## Integration Features

### Unified Insights Endpoint
`GET /api/integrated-insights/<user_id>` provides comprehensive analysis combining all modules:
- Current coherence state
- Temporal patterns and optimal timing
- Recovery needs and protocols
- AI usage recommendations
- Cultural calibration insights
- Development trajectory prediction

### Smart Recommendations
The system now provides context-aware recommendations like:
- "Schedule important decisions Tuesday mornings when your coherence peaks"
- "Your AI dependency is approaching concerning levels - implement 48-hour AI fast"
- "Based on your cultural context, focus on community contribution to improve coherence"
- "You're entering a breakthrough window - increase reflection practices this week"

## Technical Implementation

### Module Architecture
Each enhancement is implemented as a standalone module that can be:
- Used independently via API
- Combined with other modules for richer insights
- Extended with additional features
- Calibrated for specific use cases

### Data Flow
1. Core assessment generates baseline coherence profile
2. Enhancement modules analyze specific aspects
3. Integration layer combines insights
4. Personalized recommendations generated
5. Progress tracked over time

### Performance Considerations
- Temporal analysis requires 10+ historical assessments for accuracy
- Group analysis scales O(n²) with group size
- Development prediction confidence increases with more data points
- Cultural calibration can be pre-computed for common contexts

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Coherence Resonance Mapping**: Identify people with compatible coherence frequencies
2. **Micro-Coherence Tracking**: Moment-to-moment coherence via wearables
3. **Organizational Coherence Dashboard**: Team/company-wide coherence optimization
4. **Coherence-Based Matching**: For relationships, mentoring, collaboration
5. **Predictive Intervention Timing**: ML-based optimal intervention scheduling

### Research Integration:
- Validation studies with psychology departments
- Cross-cultural coherence expression research
- AI-human co-evolution longitudinal studies
- Group dynamics field studies
- Intervention effectiveness trials

## Usage Examples

### Personal Development:
```python
# Get comprehensive development plan
trajectory = predict_development(user_id, life_context, support_system)
plan = generate_personalized_plan(trajectory, available_time=45, personality='introvert')
```

### Team Optimization:
```python
# Analyze team coherence
team_state = analyze_group_coherence(team_member_ids, GroupType.WORK_TEAM)
catalysts = identify_coherence_catalysts(team_profiles)
interventions = generate_team_interventions(team_state, catalysts)
```

### AI Usage Optimization:
```python
# Check AI interaction health
impact = track_ai_coherence_impact(interaction_history, current_profile)
if impact.dependency_score > 0.7:
    recovery_plan = generate_ai_dependency_recovery()
```

## Conclusion

These enhancements transform GCT from a static assessment tool into a dynamic development system that:
- Understands individual patterns and rhythms
- Provides actionable recovery protocols
- Monitors AI's impact on human authenticity
- Respects cultural differences
- Models group dynamics
- Predicts and optimizes development trajectories

The beauty is that each enhancement makes the others more powerful - understanding your temporal patterns improves recovery protocols, which helps optimize AI usage, which strengthens group coherence, which accelerates development.

Together, they create a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing genuine human coherence in all its expressions.
