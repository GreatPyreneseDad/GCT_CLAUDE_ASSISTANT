# GCT Assistant: Grounded Coherence Theory for Personal and Communication Assessment

A Claude-importable repository implementing Grounded Coherence Theory for self-understanding and communication analysis.

## Core Framework

### The Four Variables of Human Coherence

**Ψ (Psi) - Internal Consistency** (0.0-1.0)
- Cross-situational moral consistency
- Belief-action alignment
- Emotional authenticity
- Values-behavior matching

**ρ (Rho) - Accumulated Wisdom** (0.0-1.0, age-adjusted)
- Learning from setbacks and challenges
- Pattern recognition across contexts
- Decision improvement over time
- Integration of difficult experiences

**q - Moral Activation Energy** (0.0-1.0, biologically optimized)
- Response to injustice and moral challenges
- Willingness to act on principles despite cost
- Sustainable courage without extremism
- Individual optimization parameters

**f - Social Belonging Architecture** (0.0-1.0)
- Quality and depth of relationships
- Cultural resonance and belonging
- Network position and influence
- Authentic connection capacity

### Dynamic Coherence Analysis

**Static Coherence Score:**
```
C = Ψ + (ρ × Ψ) + q_optimal + (f × Ψ)
```

**Dynamic Coherence Velocity:**
```
dC/dt = Ψ̇(1 + ρ + f) + ρΨ̇ + q̇_optimal + fΨ̇
```

## Assessment Protocols

### Tier 1: Quick Assessment (15-20 minutes)
For general self-understanding and communication awareness

### Tier 2: Professional Assessment (45-60 minutes)  
For leadership development and team dynamics

### Tier 3: Advanced Analysis (2-3 hours)
For organizational optimization and research applications

## Key Capabilities

### Personal Assessment
- **Coherence Profiling**: Understand your authentic self across the four dimensions
- **Development Tracking**: Monitor growth and integration over time
- **Timing Optimization**: Identify optimal moments for leadership and creative action
- **Blind Spot Detection**: Recognize areas of potential self-deception or howlround

### Communication Analysis
- **Authenticity Detection**: Assess coherence vs. manipulation in communications
- **Influence Mapping**: Understand transmission dynamics in conversations
- **Echo Chamber Recognition**: Identify when groupthink or howlround is occurring
- **Constructive Dialogue**: Frame conversations to increase mutual coherence

### Relationship Dynamics
- **Compatibility Assessment**: Understand coherence alignment between people
- **Network Position**: Assess your role and influence in social/professional networks
- **Conflict Resolution**: Apply coherence principles to resolve disagreements
- **Team Optimization**: Improve collective coherence and effectiveness

### Core Functions

#### Personal Assessment
```python
def assess_coherence_profile(responses, context="general"):
    """Generate comprehensive coherence assessment"""
    psi = calculate_internal_consistency(responses)
    rho = calculate_accumulated_wisdom(responses, age_adjust=True)
    q = calculate_moral_activation(responses, optimize_individual=True)
    f = calculate_social_belonging(responses)
    
    static_coherence = psi + (rho * psi) + q + (f * psi)
    
    return {
        'variables': {'psi': psi, 'rho': rho, 'q': q, 'f': f},
        'static_coherence': static_coherence,
        'insights': generate_personalized_insights(psi, rho, q, f),
        'development_recommendations': suggest_growth_areas(psi, rho, q, f)
    }
```

#### Communication Analysis
```python
def analyze_message_coherence(text, speaker_profile=None):
    """Analyze text for coherence patterns and authenticity"""
    consistency_score = assess_message_consistency(text)
    wisdom_indicators = detect_wisdom_markers(text)
    moral_activation = assess_moral_content(text)
    social_awareness = evaluate_social_sensitivity(text)
    
    authenticity_score = calculate_authenticity_likelihood(
        consistency_score, wisdom_indicators, moral_activation, social_awareness
    )
    
    return {
        'coherence_assessment': {
            'consistency': consistency_score,
            'wisdom': wisdom_indicators,
            'moral_activation': moral_activation,
            'social_awareness': social_awareness
        },
        'authenticity_score': authenticity_score,
        'red_flags': identify_manipulation_patterns(text),
        'enhancement_suggestions': suggest_coherence_improvements(text)
    }
```

#### Relationship Mapping
```python
def map_relationship_dynamics(person_a_profile, person_b_profile):
    """Analyze coherence compatibility and interaction patterns"""
    compatibility = calculate_coherence_compatibility(person_a_profile, person_b_profile)
    transmission_dynamics = predict_influence_patterns(person_a_profile, person_b_profile)
    growth_potential = assess_mutual_development_opportunity(person_a_profile, person_b_profile)
    
    return {
        'compatibility_score': compatibility,
        'influence_dynamics': transmission_dynamics,
        'growth_opportunities': growth_potential,
        'potential_conflicts': identify_coherence_tensions(person_a_profile, person_b_profile),
        'optimization_strategies': suggest_relationship_improvements(person_a_profile, person_b_profile)

```

## Usage Examples

### Personal Development
```python
# Take initial assessment
profile = gct.assess_coherence_profile(assessment_responses)

# Track development over time
tracker = gct.ContinuousTracker(profile)
monthly_updates = tracker.collect_update()
trajectory = tracker.analyze_development_trajectory()

# Get personalized recommendations
recommendations = gct.generate_development_plan(profile, trajectory)
```

### Communication Enhancement
```python
# Analyze your own message before sending
message = "I think we should consider a different approach..."
analysis = gct.analyze_message_coherence(message, your_profile)

if analysis['authenticity_score'] < 0.7:
    improved_message = gct.suggest_coherence_improvements(message)
    
# Analyze incoming communication
incoming_analysis = gct.analyze_message_coherence(incoming_message)
if incoming_analysis['red_flags']:
    response_strategy = gct.generate_constructive_response(incoming_analysis)
```

### Team Optimization
```python
# Assess team coherence
team_profiles = [assess_coherence_profile(member) for member in team]
team_coherence = gct.calculate_collective_coherence(team_profiles)

# Optimize team composition
optimal_roles = gct.suggest_role_assignments(team_profiles)
collaboration_strategies = gct.optimize_team_interactions(team_profiles)
```

## Ethical Guidelines

### Privacy Protection
- All assessments are processed locally when possible
- Personal coherence data remains under user control
- No tracking or profiling without explicit consent
- Right to delete all personal data

### Responsible Use
- Framework for self-understanding, not judgment of others
- Avoid using for manipulation or control
- Respect cultural differences in coherence expression
- Professional boundaries in workplace applications

### Accuracy Limitations
- Assessments are tools for reflection, not definitive judgments
- Cultural calibration needed for diverse populations
- Individual variation in coherence expression
- Continuous validation and improvement needed

## Research Integration

### Validation Studies
- Ongoing empirical validation of assessment accuracy
- Cross-cultural coherence expression research
- Longitudinal tracking of coherence development
- Correlation with external outcome measures

### Academic Collaboration
- Open research protocols for academic validation
- Anonymized aggregate data for research (with consent)
- Integration with established psychological frameworks
- Peer review and methodological improvement
